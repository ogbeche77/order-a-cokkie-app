## General info

The Goal is to implement a game with two independent units – the players – communicating with each other using an API

## How to run the app

1. Extract both the client and server folder to any folder of your choice.
2. CD into the client and run “npm install” without quotes to install all dependencies.
3. Then run “npm start” without quotes to start the application. The application will be served on localhost:3000. Visit http://localhost:3000 on your browser to load the application.
4. CD into the server folder and also run “npm install” without quotes to install all dependencies
5. Then run “node index.js” to start the server. (Ensure that client server is also still running on localhost:3000)
